It enables applications that are context-aware and can reason about complex tasks.

The framework consists of several key components:
1. LLMs and Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and a generic interface for all LLMs.
2. Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call and are sequences of calls.
3. Data Augmented Generation: Involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource.
4. Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take.
5. Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent.

LangChain provides a standard interface through which you can interact with many different types of LLMs.`

## Introduction
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

## Core Concepts

### LLMs
Large Language Models are the foundation of LangChain applications.

### Chains
Chains combine multiple components together.

### Agents
Agents use LLMs to decide which actions to take.`
